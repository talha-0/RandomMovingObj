# Random Moving Dot

A smooth animated dot that moves randomly around the screen using Python's built-in turtle graphics module.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `turtle` (included with the standard Python installation)

No external Python packages are required.

## Using a .venv (Recommended)

Create and activate a project-local virtual environment named `.venv` (steps below). Using a `.venv` directory keeps the environment inside the project root.

### macOS / Linux

Create:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows (Command Prompt)

Create:

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate:

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

Create:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you receive an execution policy error in PowerShell, run (as administrator or for the current user):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talha-0/RandomMovingObj
cd RandomMovingObj
```

2. Create and activate the `.venv` as shown above.

3. Run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with your script filename if different.

4. When finished, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```
